##hello everyone
Our project converting audio morse code to corresponding english alphabet
What kind of problem does it solve?
The problem is that many people don't know Morse code. In times of danger, she can
save a lot of lives. But people usually miss the opportunity to save themselves or someone
because of not knowing.

We have been working on a project that will help solve the above problem. Namely ,
with the help of our project , people will be able to learn Morse code . They can learn letters
and then words . The main distinguishing feature is that they can work through the audio
input and test themselves. In all sites where Morse code is translated , there is no function as
an audio input , which limits the capabilities of users .

Looking at our database
We have created our own database , which consists of 780 audio recordings
containing sounds from letters in the form of Morse code . Each letter has its own folder
inside which there are exactly 30 audio recordings where that letter is recorded .We took
English as the language. Since there are 26 letters in the English language, there are 780 data
in total.The data consists of Morse code sounds, we transmitted them in different surfaces.
For example, by clapping, sounds from YouTube, knocks on the table, on the wall and glass.

How our project works?
Firstly, it takes audio data in morse code alphabet and translates it to english alphabet, user can 
record their morse audio at real time and prdeicts what kind of you letter is it. Additionally you 
can see spectrograms in our code, and we diplayed it by converting audio to waveforms and waveforms
to spectrogram. We worked with CNN model. We used Conv2D because it enables us to extract significant characteristics
from images that may be used for additional analysis or classification.
We used dropout layer to avoid overfitting, which happens when a model grows overly complicated and starts to memorize
the training data instead of learning to generalize to new, unforeseen data. We used
MaxPooling2D to reduce the spatial dimensionality of feature maps, to prevent overfitting,
and to capture salient features of the input image.
